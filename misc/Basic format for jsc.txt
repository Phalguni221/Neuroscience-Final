Steps:
- Fix databasse connection bug
	- try restarting
	- Maybe try some other troubleshooting steps
	- if that doesn't work, go back to previous commit. 
- Finish the App.jsx file
	- Make sure that the layout matches the layout that we are looking for
- For every endpoint (/acticles, /tech, /newInfo)
	- use the res.render funtion for the resepective jsx view
		-each view should look similar to the current newInfo.jsx file.
- Go through the file structure and remove any unused/unnecessary code.
